Safely and easily call functions that may not be available (such as those provided by a plugin that gets deactivated)

== Description ==

Safely and easily call functions that may not be available (such as those provided by a plugin that gets deactivated).

Assuming you had something like this in a template:

`<?php list_cities('Texas', 3); ?>`

If you deactivated the plugin that provided `list_cities()`, your site would generate an error when that template is accessed.

You can instead use `_sfc()`, which is provided by this plugin to call other functions, like so:

`<?php _sfc('list_cities', 'Texas', 3); ?>`

That will simply do nothing if the `list_cities()` function is not available.

If you'd rather display a message when the function does not exist, use `_sfcm()` instead, like so:

`<?php _sfcm('list_cities', 'The cities listing is temporarily disabled.', 'Texas', 3); ?>`

In this case, if `list_cities()` is not available, the text "The cities listing is temporarily disabled." will be displayed.

== Installation ==

1. Unzip `safe-function-call.zip` inside the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or upload `safe-function-call.php` into `/wp-content/plugins/`
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' admin menu in WordPress
1. Use either of the two functions provided by this plugin as often as desired

== Template Tags ==

The plugin provides two functions for your use. *Note: These functions are not limited to use in templates*

= Functions =

* `<?php function _sfc($function_name) ?>`
This will safely invoke the function by the name of `$function_name`.  You can specify an arbitrary number of additional arguments that will get passed to `$function_name()`.  If `$function_name()` does not exist, nothing is displayed and no error is generated.

* `<?php function _sfcm($function_name, $message_if_missing = '') ?>`
The same as `_sfc()` except that it displays a message (the value of `$message_if_missing`), if `$function_name()` does not exist.

= Arguments =

* `$function_name`
A string representing the name of the function to be called.

* `$message_if_missing`
(For `_sfcm()` only.)  The message to be displayed if `$function_name()` does not exist as a function.

= Examples = 

* `<?php _sfc('list_cities', 'Texas', 3); /* Assuming list_cities() is a valid function */ ?>`
"Austin, Dallas, Fort Worth"

* `<?php _sfc('list_cities', 'Texas', 3); /* Assuming list_cities() is not a valid function */ ?>`
""

* `<?php _sfcm('list_cities', 'Texas', 'Unable to list cities at the moment', 3); /* Assuming list_cities() is a valid function */ ?>`
"Austin, Dallas, Fort Worth"

* `<?php _sfcm('list_cities', 'Texas', 'Unable to list cities at the moment', 3); /* Assuming list_cities() is not a valid function */ ?>`
"Unable to list cities at the moment"
